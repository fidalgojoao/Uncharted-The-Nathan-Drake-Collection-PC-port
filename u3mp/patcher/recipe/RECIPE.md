# Overlay rebuild recipe (patcher phase 1)

Goal: regenerate the four game-data overlays the launcher loads over the retail PS4 game
(`work/overlay-r3` > `overlay-r2` > `overlay-port` > `overlay-mp`) from a user's own game copies, so
the patcher ships only scripts. This folder is the recipe; `../tools/` holds every script it runs.

## Inputs (what the user points the patcher at)

| input | how it is recognised (region-agnostic, content only) | what is read |
|---|---|---|
| PS4 Nathan Drake Collection folder (`--ps4`) | `eboot.bin`, `sce_sys/param.sfo`, `u3data/build/main/{pak23_ps4.txt,core.psarc,dc1,pak23,actor33,sound1}`, `u2data/build/main/sound1` | retail paks, dc1, text, `u2data`/`u3data` sound streams, `param.sfo` TITLE_ID (for the PKG of phase 2) |
| PS3 Uncharted 3 data (`--ps3-u3`, repeatable, folders are scanned 4 levels deep) | **disc**: `build/main/pak23.psarc` or `actor33.psarc`; **update** (1.19): `dlc-patch18.psarc` / `dlc-patch13.psarc`; **data2** (written by the game/server): `net18.bin`, `build/main/*-7.psarc`; **dlcmaps**: `dlc-map1..4.psarc`. `PARAM.SFO` is only used to label the folder and to reject a non-Uncharted-3 title. | see the steps |
| PS3 Uncharted 2 data (`--ps3-u2`) | `build/main/pak22.psarc` / `actor27.psarc` / `dc1.psarc` | nothing today (0 overlay files come from U2; the folder is required because the patcher is for owners of all three games) |

On this PC: PS4 `D:/2. PS Games/PS4/Uncharted - The Nathan Drake Collection [CUSA02320]`; PS3 U3 disc
`D:/2. PS Games/PS3/Uncharted 3 - ... [BCES01670]/PS3_GAME/USRDIR` (GOTY 01.10), update
`RPCS3/dev_hdd0/game/BCES01670/USRDIR` (1.19), data2 `.../BCES01670DATA2/USRDIR`, dlcmaps
`.../BCES01176/USRDIR`; PS3 U2 `D:/2. PS Games/PS3/Uncharted 2 - Among Thieves [BCES00757]/PS3_GAME/USRDIR`
(01.00; RPCS3 also has `BCES00757` 1.09 and `BCUS98123` 1.33).

## Running it

```
cd "PKG Converter/recipe"
python rebuild_overlays.py --ps4 "<PS4 folder>" --ps3-u3 "<U3 disc folder>" --ps3-u3 "<RPCS3 dev_hdd0/game>" \
                           --ps3-u2 "<U2 folder>" --out "<output folder>" [--speech-langs all] [--continue-on-error]
python verify_output.py "<output folder>"          # compares with manifest.tsv, per family
python rebuild_overlays.py --list                   # the step table
```

Output: `<out>/work/overlay-*` (the overlays), `<out>/work/backup-*` (what the fix scripts replaced),
`<out>/scratch/<job>` (rendered scripts), `<out>/_recipe/state.json` + `log.txt`. Re-running on the
same `--out` skips steps whose recorded outputs are unchanged and steps whose files already equal
the reference manifest, so updates are incremental. Python 3.11+; numpy (and Pillow, ffmpeg) for
the steps that say so (`--list`, `needs`).

Hidden files (1.8.0): the game loads the overlays first-wins (r3, r2, port, mp), so a level or actor pak of a
lower overlay with the same path as one in a higher overlay is never read. 740 manifest files are hidden that way
(r2 pak23 179, port pak23 85, port actor33 452, r2 actor33 24; `recipe_lib.shadowed_files()`). The driver writes
them to `<out>/_recipe/shadowed.tsv` and passes it as `RECIPE_SHADOWED`; `levels.py` and `build_actors.py` skip
them (a hidden pak that a visible `copy` row needs is still built), the manifest-state check ignores them, and
`verify_output.py` counts them as `hidden` instead of `missing` and gives the match rate over the files the game
loads. `--all-files` builds them as well (only for comparing every file with the manifest). No later step reads or
patches a hidden pak (checked 2026-11-06: the only writers of those paths are the two builders).
Worker processes: `--jobs N`, default logical cores - 2 (`RECIPE_JOBS` for levels.py, build_actors.py,
convert_banks.py). The sound-bank encoder uses `sound-banks/native/vagenc.dll` (the original vagenc.c compiled,
byte-identical to vagenc.py, ~30x faster) when it loads, else the Python port.
Level converter fast paths (`pak23-levels/lib/fastpaths.py`, installed by convert_one.py): a py-spy profile of the
r3 stage conversions (2026-11-06) put 37 % of the time in `collision._enc_box` (per-scalar float32 loops) and 27 %
in `ps3geom._bits_be` (bit fields read through one big Python int, quadratic). Both are replaced by vectorised
numpy versions with the same float32 operations in the same order and the same integer results, only where the
loaded converter's function is the known original (source sha256); `lib/check_fastpaths.py` compares them on random
inputs, and the r3 paks were rebuilt byte-identical with them. `U3_LEVELS_FAST=0` turns them off.

## Files in this folder

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `manifest.tsv` / `manifest.json` | reference: overlay, path, size, sha256, mtime of all 15 541 overlay files (`make_manifest.py`) |
| `provenance.tsv` | per file: class and source (`provenance.py`, from the hash tables below) |
| `lists/*.tsv` | copy lists of the copy steps (destination, archive, entry, size, sha256); `levels-*.txt`, `hat-colour-only.txt` name lists |
| `steps/ORDER.txt`, `steps/NNN-<id>.json` | the step registry (see `ADDING-A-FIX.md`); `make_steps.py` regenerates the initial set |
| `rebuild_overlays.py`, `recipe_lib.py`, `verify_output.py`, `gather_tools.py` | driver, library, verifier, tool collector |
| `GAPS.md` | what cannot be regenerated and why |
| `retail-ps4-hashes.tsv`, `retail-ps4-psarc-entries.tsv`, `retail-ps4-u2data-sound.tsv`, `ps3-hashes/*.tsv`, `backup-hashes-*.tsv`, `transfer-hashes.tsv`, `stage-assets-hashes.tsv` | hash tables used for the provenance (names and hashes only, no data; `hash_tree.py`, `psarc_hash.py`) |
| `transcript-mining/` | how the session transcripts were mined for every overlay write (`SUMMARY.md`, `overlay-writes.tsv`, `inline-writes/`) |

## Families and provenance (reference overlays, 2026-11-03)

| family | files | MB | produced by | clean rebuild |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| overlay-mp `vtex1/ps4` | 882 | 124 | byte copies of PS3 UI textures: 710 loose `build/main/vtex1`, 134 `dlc-patch13`, 11 `dlc-patch18`, 25 `goty-patch`, 2 `lab-trench-v1-7` | 882 match |
| overlay-r3 `sound1/streams` | 11 980 | 379 | byte copies: 11 637 `english-mp.psarc`, 79 `goty-speech-english.psarc`, 65 `goty-dlc.psarc`, 199 PS4 `u2data` streams | 11 980 match |
| overlay-r3 `sound1/banks` | 128 | 167 | 4 retail copies; 124 PS3 banks converted by `sound-banks/convert_banks.py` | 128 match |
| overlay-r3 `pak23/ps4` | 328 | 3 864 | stage pipeline conversions (cloud) + 10 session fixes; rebuilt by `pak23-levels` (plan.tsv) | 1 + 200 match, 36 base (= recorded pre-batch / pre-session state; step cloud-batches-r3 replays the 10-30 cloud batches), 81 equivalent |
| overlay-r3 `actor33/ps4` | 538 | 284 | ps4actor conversions (cloud) + 5 session rebuild batches | 0 |
| overlay-r3 `dc1/ps4` | 281 | 6 | DC conversions (cloud) + 9 session edits; `skel-retargets.bin` from retail | 1 match + 72 by `convert-dc1` (tools/dcconv); the dctools edit steps reproduce every checkpoint exactly once the converted net.bin / menu.bin / modules.bin base exists (that base, the cloud "netfix" merge, is still missing) |
| overlay-r3 `text1/ps4` | 66 | 12 | PS4 text banks + goty-patch MP strings, `text1-merge/merge_text1.py` | 66 match |
| overlay-r3 `vtex1`, `dc2` | 10 | 10 | EULA renders, emblem, particle modules | 0 |
| overlay-r2 (`pak23` 427, `actor33` 33, `dc1` 16) | 476 | 2 277 | second conversion pass (cloud) + shade-npc copies; pak23 by `pak23-levels` | pak23: 295 match, 131 equivalent (all shadowed by r3) |
| overlay-port (`pak23` 160, `actor33` 680, `dc1` 3) | 843 | 1 096 | first conversion pass (cloud) + shade-npc copies; pak23 by `pak23-levels` | pak23: 138 match, 1 base, 21 equivalent |
| overlay-mp `actor33`, `pak23` | 5 | 13 | `convert_net.py` + 3 actor conversions; `net-ingame12.pak` retail copy | 1 match |
| `pak23_ps4.txt` x4 | 4 | 3 | `mkregistry.py` + lab_reg / apply_maps / air_emblem / shade_npc; final state by `registry-final` (line provenance) | 4 match |
| **total** | **15 541** | **8 234** | | **12 869 match = 82.8 % of files, 495 MB = 6.0 % of bytes; 4 differ, 2 668 missing** |

Everything in the "cloud" column was converted between 2026-10-25 and 10-30 in a Claude cloud sandbox
with `u3mp/paktools`; the command lines never reached this PC (details and remedies in `GAPS.md`).
The session fixes of 2026-10-31 .. 11-03 are all shipped as steps; those that only patch an existing
converted pak run once the conversion exists.

## Step order (steps/ORDER.txt)

1. `copy-ps3-vtex1`, `copy-ps3-speech`, `copy-ps3-sfx`, `copy-ps4-retail` (byte copies, sha256-checked)
2. `convert-levels-port`, `convert-levels-r2`, `convert-levels-r3`, `convert-actors-r3`, `convert-dc1`,
   `convert-dc2-part-modules` (documented, not runnable here); `convert-banks`, `convert-text1` (runnable since 1.1.0)
3. `registry-pak23` (mkregistry)
4. session fixes in application order: `facility-collapse`, `lab-registration`*, `elim-pic`*,
   `classic-netgames`*, `skins-net-names`*, `maps-batch`*, `rpcn-menu-page`*, `skin-textures`, `wall-emblem`,
   `borneo-water-jitter`, `map-colors-lightmap`, `borneo-grass-leaf`, `coop-voice-fort`, `hair-key`*, `eula-pages`,
   `map-colors2`, `actor-materials`, `coop-desc-fix`, `excess-wall`, `hat-colour`, `airport-igc2`,
   `enemy-stall-option-defaults`, `emblem-cap3`, `coop-audit-option-defaults`, `shade-npc-paks`, `coop-voice-all`,
   `london-fade`, `airport-igc3`, `vram-gap` (* = dctools steps: restored 2026-11-05, verified sha256-identical from their backups with `tools/dcconv/verify_dctools_chain.py`; maps-batch is now `maps-batch-dc` + `maps-batch-files`, and `eula-menu-box` follows `rpcn-menu-page`)

Per-file order where several fixes touch one file (from the transcripts): `net.bin`: netfix -> lab_reg ->
elim_pic -> classic -> skins -> apply_maps -> hair_key -> coop_desc_fix -> coop_vox (rerun `classic` after
any net.bin rebuild). `modules.bin`: lab_reg -> elim_pic -> skins size table -> apply_maps -> mk_rpcn ->
apply_vo -> coop_vox. `air-multi.pak`: air_emblem -> mapcolor -> mapcolor2 -> london. `air-multi-strip.pak`:
excess -> london -> vram_gap. `facility-multi.pak`: collapse -> london. `ss-multiplayer/*.bin`: ssfix ->
option_defaults -> option_defaults_2. `vox*.bin`: apply_vo -> coop_vox.

## Timing (this PC, Python 3.15, NVMe)

* **Fresh import 1.8.0 (2026-11-06, through u3mp_import.py like a player, 12 threads, 10 workers): 56 min** for the
  recipe (3 337 s), about 99.3 % of the 14 801 files the game loads byte-identical (verify_output; 740 hidden files
  not built). Per step: convert-levels-r3 2 120 s (before the level fast paths: 247 paks), convert-banks 280 s (Python
  encoder; ~30x less with vagenc.dll), convert-actors-r3 153 s, convert-dc1 120 s, london-fade 111 s, hat-colour
  ~105 s, map-colors2 79 s, levels-lab 69 s, cloud-batches 42 s, port 27 s and r2 20 s (were 529 s and 6 146 s in
  the 1.7.0 full build, which built the hidden paks), every other step under 30 s.
* Level fast paths: 11 large/medium r3 paks in 43 s instead of 90 s (same machine, 10 workers), all identical.

* Clean rebuild of everything that can run: **96 s** (copy steps 13 s for 12 868 files / 495 MB; the rest is
  script steps failing fast for lack of converted bases). A second run on the same output: 37 s (copies
  verified by hash and skipped).
* Update-mode run on a copy of the reference overlays (8.2 GB): 56 s the first time (the manifest-state check
  hashes the files a step owns, up to 3.9 GB for the pak23 steps), 21 s the second time. Result: 15 537 of
  15 541 files untouched and identical; every script step reported "already applied" / "already at the
  reference state"; the 4 `pak23_ps4.txt` differ only because `registry-pak23` ran once before the
  reference-state check existed (it drops the lab34 lines that `lab-registration`/`maps-batch` add; on a
  complete overlay the step is now skipped). Test outputs were on `D:/1. PC Games/Uncharted-windows/u3-recipe-test*`
  and were deleted; the verify reports are in `test-results/`.
* Not measured (not runnable here): the conversion pipelines. From the batch timestamps the cloud passes took
  about a day each; `batch_hats.py` and `actor-materials/build.py` run for hours.

## Dependencies (recipe 1.1.0, verified 2026-11-05)

| what | version used | steps |
|---|---|---|
| Python | 3.15.1 (driver default `C:\Python315`), 3.14.10, 3.13.18 all work | all |
| numpy | 2.5.4 | `map-colors-lightmap` (verified: 14/14 paks = recorded md5_after), `map-colors2`, `wall-emblem`, `actor-materials`, `excess-wall`, `hat-colour`, `london-fade`; paktools `ps4actor`/`texcodec`/`bggeom` |
| Pillow | 13.0.0 | `eula-pages` (JPEG flip + q95 re-save is part of the reference bytes) |
| ffmpeg | 8.1.1 (msys2 clang64) | `eula-pages` (lanczos mips; 7/7 identical), `convert-banks` (MP3 decode for 95 banks; 8.1.1 and the original 6.1.1 give identical banks) |

A step whose `python:` need is missing in the driver's interpreter is skipped with a message; run the driver with a
Python that has numpy + Pillow (the patcher should bundle one). ffmpeg is looked up in `RECIPE_FFMPEG`, PATH and
`C:/msys64/clang64/bin/ffmpeg.exe`; without it `eula-pages` writes equivalent pages and `convert-banks` skips the MP3 banks.
`gather_tools.py` no longer re-gathers `map-colors`, `eula-batch`, `sound-banks`, `text1-merge` (maintained in `tools/fixes`).


## DC tools (2026-11-05)

* `tools/fixes/dctools/common.py`, `dcedit.py`, `dcsyms.py`: the original DC reader / append-only editor / symbol inserter (u3mp/dctools of the U3_Multiplayer branch; the originals are kept in `tools/dctools-recovered/` with the other 20 scripts of that folder). Steps that import them name `with_jobs: ["dctools"]` (the driver renders that job too and puts it on PYTHONPATH).
* `tools/dcconv/dcconv.py`: PS3 -> PS4 DC converter. `learn` aligns PS3/PS4 pairs object by object and keeps a layout per object key; `convert` lays a PS3 module out from the learned schemas; `test` compares with reference files. `schema-oldconv.json` (shipped) holds the layouts of the 2026-10-27 cloud conversions; the retail schema is learned on the user's PC from the PS3 disc and PS4 Collection DC modules (about 10 minutes, cached in `work/_dcconv/`).
* `tools/dcconv/verify_dctools_chain.py --project <P> --test <dir on D:>`: reruns every dctools step from its backup and compares with the next checkpoint (29 checks). `make_convert_list.py` regenerates `fixes/dcconv/dc1-convert.tsv`.
* `dc-recipes` (step 085, `tools/fixes/dcconv/apply_recipes.py`): rebuilds every DC file `convert-dc1` does not reproduce - the merged modules (net.bin, menu.bin, modules.bin, medals, looks, scenes, vox*, weapon-*, net-always-loaded(.dci), ss-coop-adv-fort, dc2 part modules, overlay-r2 / overlay-port DC) and 80 ss / ai / render-settings conversions - from `tools/dcconv/dc-recipes.json.gz` (`dcrecipe.py`: copy ops over the user's PS4 retail and PS3 1.19 files, pointer slots, 5947 literal bytes in all). `make_recipes.py` regenerates the recipes from the reference overlays. With convert-dc1 and the option-default fixes this gives 302/303 dc1+dc2 files sha256-identical (+ skel-retargets.bin from airport-igc3).
